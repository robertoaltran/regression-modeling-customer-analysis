# Regression Modeling – Customer Data Analysis

This project was developed as part of the **Regression Modeling** course during my Bachelor of Information Sciences with a major in Data Science at Massey University, New Zealand.

## 📘 Course
**Course name:** Regression Modeling  
**Institution:** Massey University  
**Program:** Bachelor of Information Sciences – Major in Data Science  
**Semester:** [Semester 2, 2023]

## 📊 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to apply linear regression techniques to explore and model customer behavior using real-world data. The analysis includes variable selection, correlation analysis, multicollinearity checks, diagnostic plots, and evaluation of model performance.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- R
- R Markdown
- tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)
- stats
- knitr

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Assignment 2.Rmd` – Main R Markdown analysis file  
- `Assignment 2.html` – Rendered report (can be opened in browser)  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 📈 Summary of Results
The final regression model achieved good explanatory power after transforming variables and removing multicollinear predictors. Diagnostic plots confirm the model assumptions are reasonably met. This project demonstrates the ability to apply statistical modeling techniques and communicate insights through code and visualizations.

## ▶️ How to Reproduce
1. Open `Assignment 2.Rmd` using RStudio.
2. Ensure the required R packages are installed (`tidyverse`, `knitr`, `stats`).
3. Click **"Knit"** to generate the HTML report.
